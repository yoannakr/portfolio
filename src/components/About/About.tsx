          <p>
            I am passionate about coding and solving problems through code. A
            person who cares about the details.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've recently graduated Bachelor's degree in Computer and Software
            Engineering at Technical University of Sofia. Currently, I am
            working both front end and back end at Microinvest.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy figuring out the logic behind creating applications but I am
            more interested in learning how to make it look pretty to users.
            That's why I want to switch my career in front end development.
          </p>
